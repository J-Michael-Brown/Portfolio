              <p>I've had <em>some</em> previouse coding experience in highschool. I have worked most extensively with <span class="language">c++</span>, although I have used several GUI coding languages for small project practice.</p>
              <p>I have been taught that the greatest skill for a develpor is the ability to learn: to understand how and why things work.</p>

              <p>Ultimately I'm <strong>most</strong> interested in videogame devolopment. It didn't take much looking into to find that it's not only a competitive field, but not job secure nor friendly to the developer working. So, for now my short term goals are as follows:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Learn and be able to follow proper work-flow</li>
                <li>Understand project setup steps</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>why they are in the order they are in</li>
                  <li>what happens when someone makes a mistake</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Become comfortable at working on development projects in groups</li>
